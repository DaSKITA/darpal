# DARPAL
**Data Access Request Process Automation Language**

With this proposed schema for data subject access request (DSAR) processes, we aim to pave the way for automated data access. The desired results of the work should provide one-click solution for data subjects and serve as a starting point for further research in this area. 

## Schema
The schema has three main building blocks: meta information, request interface and request parameters.

## Process Repository
We provide a process repository with 15 provider-specific DARPAL documents [here](https://github.com/DaSKITA/darpal-documents).

## Applications
We provide a prototypical implementation of such a one-click request processes: https://daskita.github.io/dara-frontend/
